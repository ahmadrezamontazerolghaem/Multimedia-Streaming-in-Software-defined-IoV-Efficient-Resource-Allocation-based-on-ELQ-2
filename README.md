The rapid growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the increasing rise of various multimedia services have led to resource crises for IoV networks' servers and switches. IoV network-connected multimedia vehicles are increasing; millions of vehicles and heavy multimedia traffic. Resource scarcity of this network causes overload, leading to a loss of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). On the other hand, resource abundance causes energy waste. The Optimal management of IoV network resources with energy, load, QoS, and QoE constraints is a complex problem. This study decomposes this problem to reduce its complexity by designing an IoV modular architecture called $ELQ^2$ to control the mentioned constraints simultaneously. To achieve this objective, Network Softwarization and Virtualization concepts are employed. This modern architecture allows dynamically adjusting of the scale of the resources on demand, effectively reducing energy usage. Additionally, this architecture provides some other potentials, such as the distribution of multimedia traffic among servers, determining the route with high QoS for traffic, and selecting a media with high QoE. A real test field is provided by Floodlight Controller, Open vSwitch, and Kamailio Server tools to evaluate the performance of $ELQ^2$. The results indicate that $ELQ^2$ can minimize the number of active servers and switches through resource management. Moreover, it improves the parameters of QoS and QoE, including throughput, multimedia delay, R Factor, and MOS through load balance.
